# Generative Agent
This Project was made to play around with Large Language Models (LLMs)
For this: 
  * You need to install Ollama locally, other possibilities are:
    use API to connect to a Model. 
  * Also you can use Google Colab if you need to work with bigger modells with Billions of parameters
  * I used mitral and codellama in this project
  * The mitral model as well as the codellama model must atleat run once in order for it to be activated
  * Use this command in your terminal: Ollama run <model_name>
